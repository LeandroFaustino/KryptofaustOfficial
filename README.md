This was my final project to complete my Multimedia course where I learned the very basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.
Its a small WebSite that serves as to showcase my musical carreer and work done, as well to contact me.
The core objective was to make a project that featured at least two media skills that we had learned in the course, so I chose Graphic Design, Visual Identity, and Programming.
The project isnt alocated in any server yet. 
This project features:
  -Front-End: 
        -HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP.
        -Very basic PHP for the "contact" form.
        -Graphic Design and Visual Identity.
